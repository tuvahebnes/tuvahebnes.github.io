    Global warming is expected to bring major changes to climates around the world, causing shifts in climate zones,
    a rise in sea levels, and fluctuations in weather patterns never seen before. Farmlands may experience droughts, 
    while deserts could become vast stretches of oases. Food crop reduction is a possibility and the salination of 
    groundwater is very likely. Vicious storms will become more frequent and hot climates could see a drastic rise 
    in their mean temperatures. Ice caps will melt, entire countries will report much colder temperatures, and 
    islands may disappear. Islands like Tuvalu's coral atolls. Will they disappear?
